# hello-world
About me & contact information

My name is Mycole, pronounced the same as Michael. 

**About me:**
I am a sophomore at Southern New Hampshire University to obtain my BS in computer science with a concentration in Software Engineering, and I am going to be a software engineer. I have extensive experience in finance working for an investment firm, advisory firm, and a bank where I still currently work. I hold advanced investment and insurance licenses. I would love to work in a position where my love for coding and finance can combine, but would be overjoyed to work in any industry if it means I get to be a programmer. Outside of work I am a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu and train at a Gracie Barra gym. 

**Accomplishments:**
You can see most of what I have been working on in my repositories, but other accomplishments I am proud of are:

* Learned the command line and completed Codecademy's course, afterwards I successfully programmed and ran python programs directly from my terminal without using any IDEs like visual studio code. I also learned about nano and how to configure the environment which I did to both my Mac and Windows computers. 
* Gained a foundational knowledge of Python by completing the Learn Python 3 course on Codecademy. I used that knowledge to program most of my first repositories which included a program that solves sudoku puzzles uzing a backtracking algorithm, and a rock paper scissors game you can play on your terminal. 

**What I am working on now:**
  - I am now going through the Computer Science Career Path course on Codecademy.
