# hello-world
first repository from tutorial 

My name is Mycole, pronounced the same as Michael. I am a father to two kids. One 4 year old, and one 2 month old. I am currently learning to code in hopes of making a career change. As of this first repository I have completed a college level JAVA programming course, and completed the learn Python 3 course on Code Academy. I am also familiarizing myself with RobotFramework and Qweb. Outside of work and family I am a active practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at a Gracia Barra school.
