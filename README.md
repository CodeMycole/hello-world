About me & contact information

My name is Mycole, pronounced the same as Michael. 

**About me:**
I am a father to two kids. One 4 year old, and one 2 month old. I married my highschool sweatheart who i have been dating since freshman year. I am currently learning to code in hopes of making a career change. I am a Colorado Native. I currently speak English and German; however, since I can only speak high german, it's pretty weak depending on who I am talking to. I have been to Germany twice, once as an exchange student in high school, and another time I was apart of the first american band to play in the Folksfest parade in Muldorf Am Inn. I am currently learning both spanish and japanese. Outside of work and family I am an active practitioner of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at a Gracia Barra school. An interesting fact about me is I use to be a professional magician, and have performed for fortune 500 company parties. 

**Accomplishments:**
As of this writing I have completed:
  - Some of the code I have been writing can be viewed in my repositories.
  - A college level JAVA programming course.
  - The learn Python 3 course on Codecademy. 

**What I am working on now:**
  - I am now going through the full-stack engineer course on Codecademy, learning how to code projects from start to finish both front-end and back-end. 
  - I am also familiarizing myself with RobotFramework and Qweb. 
  - I am studying for my Security+ Certification.

Potential employers can reach me at mycole.eversole@gmail.com, or at (719) 502-5022. I am NOT willing to relocate. Role must be remote or in Colorado. Due to my current knowledge, back-end development and cyber security positions would be the best fit.
